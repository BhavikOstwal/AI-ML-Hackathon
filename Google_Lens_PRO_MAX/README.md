# Google Lens Pro MAX
**I(Bhavik Ostwal) have developed a project using VLM (Visual Language Model)**

## Introduction
Google Lens Pro MAX is an intelligent search application that leverages deep learning models to enhance search queries by combining visual inputs and text prompts. The app uses `BLIP` model for image caption generation. These models generate a contextual query, which is then passed to the `ScrapingDog API` for retrieving relevant image search results. The application is implemented in `Streamlit`, providing users with a seamless interface for submitting images and retrieving organized, grid-based image results.

This project demonstrates how powerful open-source models and web scraping APIs can work together to provide enhanced visual search functionality, with applications spanning product search, visual discovery, and more.

## Possible Improvements
While the current implementation of Google Lens Pro MAX is functional, several enhancements can be made:

Despite its current functionality, there are several areas where **Google Lens Pro MAX** can be improved:

1. **Search Query Optimization**  
   Refining the queries generated by the BLIP model using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques could lead to even more relevant search results.

2. **Integration with Additional APIs**  
   By incorporating other free-tier image search APIs, such as SerpApi or DuckDuckGo Image Search, the app can broaden its data sources and improve search result coverage.

3. **User Feedback Mechanism**  
   Adding a feature where users can rate the relevance of images could help refine future search results and allow for the use of machine learning to improve query generation.

5. **Caching and Speed Optimization**  
   Introducing caching mechanisms for frequently searched queries could reduce response times and lower API usage costs.

7. **Domain-specific Vision Models**  
   For more specialized search applications (e.g., medical images, retail products), custom-trained vision models could be integrated to enhance accuracy and relevance in specific domains.
